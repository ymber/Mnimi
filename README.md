# Mnimi

Mnimi is a simple Python program to record and display notes and todo items. Lists are stored in a JSON file that can easily be parsed by other utilities.

## Usage

When executed with no arguments Mnimi will print the current todo list without extended notes. It can be called with `-n` to create a new todo item, `-r` to remove an existing item, or `-a` to amend an existing item. Call with `-e` to print extended notes and `-h` for help.

## Dependencies

Python >=3.6
